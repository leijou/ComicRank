                <p>Comic Rank tracks people who visit Webcomic sites, analyzes their page views and works out whether they frequently read the comic. In other words Comic Rank totals up the number of regular readers of Webcomics, rather than just pageviews.</p>
                <p>This is a great way to boost ad revenue, track campaigns, and stay motivated to keep making comics! A lot of webcomic readers are silent most of the time but we're still there loving your work and supporting your comic.</p>

                <p>Comic Rank started in 2008 as a free Webcomic leaderboard and reader tracker. The service was ad supported but as we rose in fame server costs mounted and moderation of the public leaderboards became unmanageable.</p>
                <p>In September 2012 Comic Rank shut its doors while the new incarnation was being developed. Relaunched in January 2013, Comic Rank mostly survives off of the donations from users.</p>

                <p>We'll always have more ideas than time, so the new site was launched with minimal features so it can evolve over time. Most importantly we want to get back to a stage where we can offer the service free to everyone!</p>
