## FAQ

### Can I install this?
You're welcome to give it a go but the MySQL schema is not currently in the repository. I'll look to get it in there in the future, please message me in the meantime.
To install you will need to:
* Copy config.template.txt to config.php
* Fill in the details in config.php
* Point your http server root to public/

### Isn't X a bit overkill / couldn't you use Y framework
Yes, probably. But my day job is writing large critical systems so it's nice to explore new structures, and probably make mistakes. If you can think of ways to improve them then please let me know!
