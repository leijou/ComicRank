                <p>Here you see the first draft of a Comic Rank forum, it's a bit different from normal forums in that it is semi-anonymous, so please let me explain:</p>
                <p>To post in the Comic Rank forum you must be logged in, however the posts you make are displayed anonymously. This breaks down the barriers for new users to join discussions and allows you to speak more freely without fear of repercussions.</p>
                <img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/<?=md5('abitlikethis')?>?s=80&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG" style="float: right; margin-top: 10px; margin-right: -100px;" />
                <p>Within each thread you are given a unique pattern avatar which identifies your posts. This avatar is always the same when you post in that thread, but is never the same across different threads. This avoids confusion when discussing things inside a thread but means if you say anything identifiable as yourself it wont let anyone know who you are in other threads.</p>
                <p>This is an experiment. As with everything on Comic Rank it has been made quickly to see if it works. In future we may add options to post as a normal user, or remove anonymous users all together. The only thing that is certain is we wont ever release your anonymous posts with a reference to your user, so please enjoy the freedom of posting anonymously now.</p>
                <p>While Comic Rank is in beta the forums are also only visible to members, but please be aware that they will probably be publicly viewable in the future. It will also be a bit slow since there aren't that many beta users but hopefully will get more active over time.</p>
                <p>Please feedback on what you like/dislike about this forum, and everything else on Comic Rank. Feature requests, help with Comic Rank, and general webcomic chat is all welcome too.</p>
                <p>Thanks for reading, please enjoy!</p>
